//Ask prompt, store as variable, ask for number digits and give error message if anything else is entered
//Run array function for number of times (for or while loop) mentioned in variable and form an array of randomly populated number, length should be same as entered by user
//connect the answer to display, make sure function returns the answer connect var password, save the returned value in event .. variable
